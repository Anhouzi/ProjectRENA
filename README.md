Project RENA (Re-Explored Nobunaga's Ambition) is a project done in raw C++ to try and replicate the NES game Nobunaga's Ambition as closely as I can. In it's current state, it is entirely text based and will not have the same combat features that the original game has. 

This is mainly an exercise for me to create a large code base and work within it. Some things I'm hoping to learn from this project is: 
- Create functional systems from an AI standpoint rather than starting from a user standpoint. This will help me practice creating Automated Tests when checking new features functionality. 
- Practice object oriented programming and seperation of concerns between objects. 
- Practice making strategy game AIs.
- Using good documentation practices so the code is readable.
